# b2ai-standards-registry
Bridge2AI Standards Registry data models, API specification, and other documentation.

From the Standards Core grant proposal:

> **Aim 1.2. Inventory existing standards and create the Bridge2AI Standards Registry**

> We will populate a **B2AI Standards Registry** in collaboration with DGP Standards Modules, following the recommended teaming and collaboration practices of the **Teaming Core** and data transparency practices recommended by the **Ethics Core**. Broadly, the standards in the registry will fall into three categories: (1) standards for structuring data used for testing, training, and validating AI models (e.g., genomics file formats and standards for EHR data such as FHIR, OMOP, and ISO[LoS Kisler]). (2) standards for describing specific datasets (i.e., standard computable elements associated with specific data types for use in Datasheets[69]); (3) standards for describing ML models themselves (i.e., standard computable elements associated with specific ML models for use in Model Cards[70]). Coordinated use and population of this Registry will promote cross-project communication and harmonization on standard schemas and attributes. These standards will be labeled with the maturity level for each standard as determined by the Standards Core; Draft for proposed standards approved for implementation and testing, Implemented for standards that have been successfully implemented by DGPs, and Normative for consensus standards that have demonstrated cross-DGP interoperability. The Registry will maintain attributed use cases and validation rules and examples associated with each standard or element. Where possible, existing standards (e.g., minimal information specifications[71â€“73]) will be used to inform data element selection. Importantly, the Registry will include records for standards outside the scope of data modeling, such as specifications for preferred file formats, exchange protocols, and common APIs. We will also annotate standards with their readiness for different forms of AI algorithms as well as developing tools for cleaning and pre-processing; for example, image data for GCNs, data frames for traditional statistical ML, linked data for graph-based ML. The Standards Registry will be linked and synchronized with existing resources such as BioPortal[74] and FAIRsharing[75].
Our Standards Registry goals are threefold: (1) ensure integration of the standards development lifecycle within the context of B2AI activities; (2) narrow the large space of standards to what is relevant; and (3) provide computational access and utilities for schemas and standards, rather than links to often outdated PDFs. We will enable programmatic access to the Registry via standardized APIs (defined via the OpenAPI specification and registered in SmartAPI[76]) to query standards metadata, elements, and validation rules.
