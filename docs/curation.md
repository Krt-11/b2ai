# Curation Guide

The tasks listed below all help to make the Bridge2AI Standards Registry more complete and informative.

Some tasks refer to the dataset documentation for the Grand Challenges (GCs).

This table contains the names of each GC, its identifier, and links to each its dataset documentation.

You can help with the following tasks:

## Add New Entities

To add a new entity (e.g., a standard, tool, or organization) to the Registry, use [this GitHub form](https://github.com/bridge2ai/b2ai-standards-registry/issues/new?template=newEntity.yml) to create a new issue.

This is particularly useful to do for resources used by GCs but not yet represented in the registry. To curate these entities:
1. Visit one of the data documentation pages linked in the table above.
2. When a relevant entity is mentioned, check if it exists in the registry already. The easiest way to do so (for now) is to use the search bar at the top of [these data docs](https://bridge2ai.github.io/b2ai-standards-registry/). This will tell you if a term or name is used anywhere in a table, but you will need to search in the table to find the specific entry.
3. If it exists, that's great! If not, create a new issue to add it.
