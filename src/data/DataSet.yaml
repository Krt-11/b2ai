  description: >-
    This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence
    (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program.
    This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs;
    SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons,
    and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence
    and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged
    with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using
    the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end
    of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham,
    Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center. This data is Copyright (c) 2025 The
