  name: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
  category: B2AI_DATA:DataSet
  description: >-
    This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence
    (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program.
    This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs;
    SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons,
    and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence
    and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged
    with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using
    the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end
    of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham,
    Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center. This data is Copyright (c) 2025 The

  name: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project (Version 2.0.0)
  category: B2AI_DATA:DataSet
  description: >-
    The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights
    (AI-READI) project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to
    enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)
    research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
    including salutogenic pathways to return to health. The ability to understand
    and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM has been
    limited by a lack of well-designed, high quality, large, and inclusive multimodal
    datasets. The AI-READI team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional
    dataset of 4,000 people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across
    the US. The study cohort will be balanced for self-reported race/ethnicity, gender,
    and diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit
    downstream pseudo-time manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease
    trajectories by collecting and learning from complex, multimodal data from
    participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM).
    The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in T2DM,
    agnostic to existing classification criteria or biases, which can be used to
    reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health (i.e.,
    salutogenesis). Data will be optimized for downstream AI/ML research and made publicly
    available. This project will also create a roadmap for ethical and equitable research
    that focuses on the diversity of the research participants and the workforce involved
    at all stages of the research process (study design and data collection, curation,
    analysis, and sharing and collaboration).
